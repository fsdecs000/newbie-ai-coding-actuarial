1. About the Project

Purpose:

This project is a simplified, foundational application for an actuarial project. It demonstrates how to build a basic user interface, perform simple calculations, and manage data, all in a single file. Built With:

a. HTML

b. JavaScript

c. Tailwind CSS (for styling)

d. Firebase Firestore (for the database)

2. Getting Started

a. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/fsdecs/newbie-ai-coding-actuarial.git

b. Open the file
Just open the index.html file in your web browser.

3. How it Works

a. Actuarial Calculation: The app calculates the present value of a future amount based on an interest rate and the number of periods.

b. Data Pipeline Simulation: The "Run Data Pipeline" button demonstrates a simple data engineering process by taking some raw data, processing it, and then saving the result to a database.

c. Security: The app includes a simple security check to ensure the user is authenticated before performing any actions.
